# etch-a-sketch

This is a project from the Odin Project, which the objectives are to

- Create a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs.
- Create the divs using JavaScript. Don’t try to create them by hand by copying and pasting them in your HTML file!
- It’s best to put your grid squares inside a “container” div. This div can be written in your HTML file.
- Use Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid (versus just one on each line).

Despite the name, do not be tempted to research or use CSS Grid, as it will be taught in a later lesson after the foundations path. This project is an opportunity specifically to practice Flexbox!

I revisited this project to get a better understanding of my understanding of pure JavaScript and see how much I can improve on the existing project, the website is not mobile responsive or usable yet as it relies on mousehover, maybe I'll get to it one day. For now I did one of the extra credit exercise.

**Extra credit**:
Transform the behavior of a square when interacting with the mouse by introducing a series of modifications.
1. Rather than squares being the same color throughout the grid, randomize the squares’ RGB values with each interaction.
